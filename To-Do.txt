Chat API (DMs)
  - maybe use Slack API for communication?
  - personally not a fan of slack but if there's a free api which doesn't require the kind of painful login slack wants
  - discord api is a possible solution.... it's like slack but not crap

Deploy
  - We have to deploy before Wednesday in case we run into issues, which, apparently, there's a good chance we will

Styling
  - prettying up the site
    -> Curtis/David working on it
  - side bar
  - hamburger menu button
  - project#index organization method and appearance
    -- maybe do blocks for each project with a snippet of each description (like the first 20 characters of the description with a ... at the end)
  - project#index page shows your owned projects at the top, then the projects you collaborated on under/next to it... maybe like split like a block/column, and then the rest of the unaffiliated projects underneath
  - filter search button needs some styling
    -- could be at the top, left of the HOME button
  - add a background picture to get rid of the "white space"
